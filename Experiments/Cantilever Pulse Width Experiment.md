# Questions
- how many cantilevers have contractions in a system at each pulse width?
	- note which cantilevers are affected by artifact
- How does the contraction amplitude compare at each pulse width?

# Charts
## Pulse width
- number of active cantilevers across each system
- contractions
    - average contraction amplitude across each system for each pulse width
- Number of peaks that are occluded by artifact in total and at each system
- Time it takes for a contraction to reach half relaxation
