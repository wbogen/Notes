# Development 
## Stim Plot Pop-out Refactor
### Todo
- [x] Stim peaks reset to default values for the protocols that are not loaded in the main window
- [ ] Stim ticks do not always visually update in preview window but the values do update to changes
    - When editing ticks for an ROI, the other plots in the column sometimes don't update immediately but will update after interacting with them
    - Difficult to replicate
- [ ] Plots in preview window must be interacted with for batch tick editing to work properly
    - Interacting with another plot in the column counts as an interaction
- [x] Stim Ticks not updating when changing protocol via dropdown
- [x] When loading ROI files back in, tetanusRegions load on the same ROI?
    - This doesn't seem to actually be a problem
- [x] If the stim file was selected but then failed to load video/image stack in LoadAllFiles(), many variables are updated and are now invalid. For now, kill the application instead of trying to rectify this
- [x] Use the loaded protocol for the preview stack
    - [x] Able to load in but all ROIs except for the first one in the protocol have reduced signal quality. When commenting out the downsampling line, all ROIs have reduced quality
    - Data was being transposed an extra time
- [x] stimTicks are sticking to integer values only for protocols with stims <=  1Hz
    - Was a result of stim settings being generated as integers instead of floats
- [x] Save old versions of ROI files from different runs
- [x] Add a number to the ROI button to show which one is active
- [x] Clear contractions and curve when all ROIs have been removed
- [ ] Send another job to the Monday board that changes the preview outputs to the final outputs
- [ ] Make box to show the exact timestamp that is being rendered
- [ ] Active ROI doesn't highlight on switching protocol
- [ ] 
## NMJ Team Feedback 061422
- [x] How to count NMJs
- [x] Output plots from preview window
    - Used matplotlib
- [x] Add markers for static_stim_peaks
- [x] Static popup to cover main window while loading
- [x] Minimize terminal window in batch file
    - Created error_log.txt in case an unhandled exception is raised
- [x] Popup that blocks the window while doing IO or heavy calculations that block the window from updating
    - The popup is also block with current implementation so text may not be dynamic
- [x] Make each subplot its own image file too
## ROI Counting 062322
- [x] Make the pixel magnitude over the entire frame for nmj 
    - Ended up making a hidden ROI that follows the cursor on counting protocols. Calculating the pixel magnitude over the entire frame consumes way too much memory during calculation
- [x] Add NMJ count to agg file
- [x] NMJ counts not showing up on initial load
- [x] ROIs do not load when loadAllFiles from counting protocol
# Structure Notes
- ROIs should be set active from the ROI's ```setRoiActive()``` function
Improved conda environment construction, export plot of preview window, message dialog window, save unhandled exception traceback to disk, static stim tick indicators, hide terminal for batch files

"Add NMJ count outputs to aggregated output file, hidden ROI that updates with mouse cursor location on counting protocols"

## Threading Approaches for popout
### Dedicate one thread per video
- Thread per video (8 threads): [190, 194, 191], no fatigue: [126.7, 127.8]
- Dedicate all threads for one video at a time w/ ROI cutting (8 threads): []

Order can make a big difference

### Multiple threads per video
- Create chunks per video equal to the number of threads that can be run (8 threads): 
    {
        'starting threads as they are created': [169.9, 168.9, 170.9],
        'starting threads after they are all created': [175.9, 181.4]
    }
    - doing other things is increasing load time
    - starting threads after all created makesÅ¡the main window responsive faster
CPU chugging harder than dedicated thread method
- Create chunks per video with the same number of frames per thread
    {
        'threads': 8,
        'starting threads as they are created': {300: [177.2, 176.6], 400: [167.8, 166.9], 500: [169.4], 750: [174.2]
        'starting threads after they are all created': []
    }
    {
        'threads': 4,
        'starting threads as they are created': {200: [185.6, 186.5, 182.4], 300: [179.3, 181], 400: [182.2], 500: [184.1], 750: []
        'starting threads after they are all created': []
    }
- Each thread handles video chunks w/ ROI cutting (8 threads): []

Fatigue index is only calculated for longest region. Change to sum all regions together? This is how it works in the current analysis

Hotkey for copying NMJRegionItems
- Load counting videos individually
- ROI loading progress dialog
- Bug fix for scatter plot crashes
- Help box updates
