# Current Workflow

- Experimental info communicated beforehand so know when to expect samples
- Samples submitted to Monday when ready
    - < XPS Monday.com board >
- ID for each sample based on what settings are getting tested
- Surface name comes from Monday board
    - experimental template copied from previous batch
    - modify the settings for this experiment
- Run experiment
    - outputs to a folder on device it is being run on
    - Files are manually copied and moved to office PC
- Run analysis
    - Open same software on office PC
    - analysis is a peak fitting process
        - Requires a lot of manually moving around GUI elements
- Manually gets saved to XLSX file
    - Have to create empty file first and give software the path to populate the data into 
- Do manual summing and averaging of peaks in Excel
- Upload results back to Monday.com item (xlsx file not uploaded)
