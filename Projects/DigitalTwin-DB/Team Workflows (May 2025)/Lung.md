Example batch records for recent experiments
`F:\Projects\2000's - Commercial Projects\2022 - BAT\2022.103 BAT Lung\Data\Milestone 2c\Experimental plans`

Within the next few experiments (May 2025) batch records will be updated to a new format.
- Switching to grouping by assay instead of by study
- Does not change what needs to get recorded in lab or time of it, just how the documents are organized
`F:\Projects\5000's - Internal R&D\5100 - Process Improvement\5100.001 QMS\In work documents\90000 Series\Work Instructions`

- Sys# and conditions are assigned ahead of time
- Stuff to write down about the quality of each individual construct/culture for each day
    - Have lung and BBB components
    - Same stuff for every day
    - Components managed individually by different people
- After assembly, systems are maintained as one unit
    - Different batch record documents used for pre and post assembly
- Quality of each system is used to determine which one gets assigned to a specific condition
    - Try to make sure the quality is split so equivalent quality systems are recorded for each condition
