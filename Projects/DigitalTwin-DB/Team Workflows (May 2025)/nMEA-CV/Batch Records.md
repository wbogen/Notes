There's a list of batch record documents that are developed or in development but have not yet been deployed for lab use
`F:\Projects\5000's - Internal R&D\5100 - Process Improvement\5100.001 QMS\In work documents\90000 Series\Work Instructions`
- Anything with `WI9` at the beginning is a specific batch record file

# Current Method
- Planning of tasks assigned in Monday
    - Links to images and other relevant information as subitem updates
- Imaging
    - If poor culture or electrodes not aligned, don't test system
    - Systems may be good if there are cell but can't see axons growing through the tunnels
- Have a list of materials that are needed to make doses
    - Includes details on how to make doses from materials
- predose testing
    - Write down chamber number and other important info about the quality of the chamber
    - If there is no visible activity in the Intan, mark it as such so we don't waste patient sera on a system that isn't responding
- Randomly assign systems that passed check to different dosing conditions
    - if there aren't enough good systems, prioritize the most important conditions
- Make doses in between pre and post dose testing
- Do baseline testing
- Apply dose
- Post dose testing
    - 90 minutes after dosing
    - Take notes as necessary
- Do lidocaine testing immediately after post dose
    - Only if this is the last day of testing

Separate spreadsheet used to track resources used out of what's available

# Proposed Method
- Provide PCs in the lab for managing batch records
- Implement batch record forms that are currently in progress
- DB will parse the contents of the records
    - Some records will update multiple times as the records span multiple days. Will reupload at every file modification
