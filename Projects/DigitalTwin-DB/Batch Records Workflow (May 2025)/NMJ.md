# Current Workflow
- CH# is set when the systems are assembled
    - written down by hand on the chambers
- Test every chamber predose
    - The CH# gets digitized from the folder structure generated by recording
- pick the best chambers to test
    - Criteria depends on the experiment
    - recently have been doing >10 NMJs at predose counting time
- Sort the chambers that had similar NMJ performance
    - Done outside the lab and printed out to reference which chambers need to be run on which rig and which systems got which dose
    - < link to one of these files > 
    - Chamber conditions done in triplicate to test each condition on every rig at least once
- No notes are taken during testing time
    - Just reference to printed sheet which chambers should be run at the same time (same conditions, one on each rig)
    - Only need to write if something catastrophic happens (rig breaks, stimulator breaks, etc.)
- After testing is done, do confocal imaging where only thing recorded at the time of imaging is the CH#
    - florescence staining
