- Start Date in Details tab is not correct
- The "Organ" in the "Experimental Model" definition is set to peripheral nervous system (an existing definition), should it be central nervous system?

# Cell Sample
## Definition
- Are "ventral horn motor neurons" appropriate cell type for scsc-MN?
- Need to know the iPSC cell type origin
    - Can define a new one

- For scsc-MN the supplier Neural Stem Inc. changed their name to Seneca Biopharma. Their website now redirects to PalisadeBio. I'm putting in Neural Stem Inc.

iPSC derived cells require a large number of additional information
- Certificate of Analysis
- Product ID
- Product Webpage
- Product Applications
- Patient Age
- Patient Condition
- Patient Disease
- Patient Genetics iPSC primary cell type
- phenotype
- maturity
- differentiation protocol
## Model Specific Information
- Density
    - Unit provided in paper of cells/mm^2 is not available in cell editor
    - can probably add it later from aliquot tab
- Time added
    - Assumed to be 0 here for all cells

# Compound Addition
- Each concentration begets its own group

## Curare
- 8nM
- 80nM
- 8uM
- 80uM
- 160uM
- 320uM (mentioned in paper but not included in figures)
